inside of this folder also create another markdown file. This one will be named setup.md

and in there, make it very clear that the setup needs to be as simple as possible for people and businesses to use this project. Right now, it is not clear to me what it is, and we're making it reliant on Supabase, which could be fine, but again, we should make it as simple as possible to get this up and running so that people can connect their AI agents and they can start sharing different markdown files. This is the main thing, okay? How easy it is to connect your agent zero or your open claw and give them permissions to read existing markdown files inside of our OpenDash project or upload new markdown files or create new markdown files. This is the main usability of the project, right? We need to be moving in that direction. So update this setup.md file with my exact words.
